o	Compared dietary data and biomarker of all frequent fish consumers across multiple cohorts, including Nurse’s Health Study I
o	Used Hg isotope signatures of biomarkers to evaluate potential dietary recall
o	Conducted statistical analysis to elucidate potential food modifiers for reducing MeHg absorption

Graduate Research Assistant – Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston                              Sept 2016 – July 2016
PI: Prof. Joel Schwartz

Undergraduate Research Assistant –Key Laboratory for Earth Surface Processes, Peking University           Jan 2009 – June 2015
PI: Prof. Yi Wan
♣	Established methods for in vitro metabolism of Triclosan(TCS) in various species including human
♣	Developed simultaneous analytical method for TCS and its metabolites on GC-MS and UPLC-QTOf-MS.
♣	Identified the biotransformation products of TCS responsible for the CAR activities and subsequent liver toxicities; the yeast two-hybrid assay was used to test the binding activity of Triclosan and its metabolites with CAR receptor.
♣	Finished the manuscript of the paper titled “Pathway Discovery of a Widespread Metabolic Pathway within and among Phenolic Xenobiotics”


Core member of the course project in Risk Assessment of Toxicants class –PKU, Beijing                     Sept 2013 – Jan 2014
♣	Calculated the distribution of children’s blood lead level with IEUBK model
♣	Using nationwide data of children’s blood lead levels, ascertained that the incidence of MMR increased 0.73% and reduced IQ in Chinese children resulting from blood lead concentration is 0.5239. Evaluated DALYs lost of lead exposure for children
♣	Wrote a term paper named “Health Risk Assessment of Lead Levels for Children in China”

♣	Isolated RNA produced by CYP genes from loach liver and replicated them with degenerate primers which are our own design.
♣	 Used Q-RT-PCR and DNA electrophoresis techniques to examine the expression levels of these CYP genes
