Research Interest
-----------------

Seeing is believing? What if *touching* makes more sense? I am doing
psycho-physics experiment using a computer screen, a stereoscope, a pair
of of pedals and a pair of tappers that tap on each of your hand as the
corresponding foot of the person's (point light walker or PLW, is the
term used) on the screen touches the ground, while through a stereoscope
you can *only* see one of the two point light walkers on the screen
walking in the *different direction*. With this paradigm, we can see if
the *touch* you feel on your hand has altered your visual perception.


Education Background
--------------------

-   2010 ~ Present: Bachelor of Science, Department of Psychology, Peking University

Professional Experience
-----------------------

Currently I am in the Center for Brain and Cognitive Sciences,
Department of Psychology, Peking University. I do plenty experiments
when the program is ready, most of whose is written with the help of
[Psychtoolbox][].

I am also the secretary of the Balance Theory Research Center, Peking
University. We specify philosophy as lifestyle, and take an approach
similar to Traditional Chinese Yin-Yang theories, but not the same,
where keeping balance in all the aspects of life is not as emphasized as
we do.

### Free Software Projects

#### [Ipv6-hosts-new][]

> A project aimed at gaining free access (free meaning not restricted)
> providing ipv6 addressees to some famous hostnames, which was blocked
> for some reasons in some countries.

#### [Point Light Walker][PLW]

> The official development repository for libraries for Point Light
> Walker displays using Psychtoolbox for Psychophysics research.

#### [CloudMusicbox][]

> A easy and straightforward self-hosting music-box service


### Other Work Experience

Oct 2012 - present:

-   Lab Assistant at Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Science


Computer Skills
---------------

I quite appreciate innovative works or, at least, work that an ordinary
computer is unable to do it by itself. To do so, I let most of my work
done via programming, so that I do not have to do the same thing for a
second time.

Another reason for my passion in programming is that, what I love is
*NOT* programming. The fun in programming is not in programming itself,
but the idea that by writing a program, we are describing, and sometimes
even revealing, how the world rounds. Yes, by some means, that is mostly
what mathematicians, psysicists and philosophers are trying to do with
different approaches.

Here are some softwares I like and use most of the time: 

 - Mathematical Packages: [GNU Octave][], [MATLAB][], [Psychtoolbox][],
   [R][], [SciPy][];
 - Languages: [Python][], [MATLAB][], [SHELL][], [R][], [Markdown][];
 - Applications: [LyX][], [GIT][], [VIM][], [pandoc][], [Firefox][], [VLC][];
 - Operating Systems: GNU/Linux [Debian][];
