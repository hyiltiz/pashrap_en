  I am a doctoral student at University of Michigan, School of Public Health. I have just started this September. I work with Prof. John Meeker. Here is the link for our [lab](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/meekerlab/home)



  You can know more about me in the [About me](/About me) and my [Curriculum vitae](/media/pdf/CV-09-19-2017.pdf)


<!-- > This site was created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the template was derived from the site [setImpl](http://lhzhang.com/) by Linghua Zhang; the homepage was based on the design of [Tao Zhang](http://ztpala.com/) (thanks a lot, guys!). You may need a decent web browser to view this site (such as Firefox or Chrome), otherwise the layout can be a mess and the fonts can look ugly. You can navigate to the last post by the left-arrow key (`<-`) or next post by right-arrow (`->`), or equivalently keys `J` and `K`.-->

<!--This page seems just redundant and useless. Maybe you don't want this,
