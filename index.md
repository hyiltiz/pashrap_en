I am a doctoral candidate at University of Michigan School of Public Health. I work with Prof. John Meeker. Our group have been involved in projects that span a range of topics in environmental and occupational health, here is the link for our [lab](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/meekerlab/home).



You can find more about me in the [About me](/aboutme) and my [Curriculum vitae](/media/pdf/Pahriya_Ashrap_CV.pdf).



<!-- > This site was created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the template was derived from the site [setImpl](http://lhzhang.com/) by Linghua Zhang; the homepage was based on the design of [Tao Zhang](http://ztpala.com/) (thanks a lot, guys!). You may need a decent web browser to view this site (such as Firefox or Chrome), otherwise the layout can be a mess and the fonts can look ugly. You can navigate to the last post by the left-arrow key (`<-`) or next post by right-arrow (`->`), or equivalently keys `J` and `K`.-->

<!--This page seems just redundant and useless. Maybe you don't want this,
